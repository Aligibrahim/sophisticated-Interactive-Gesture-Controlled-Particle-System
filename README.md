# sophisticated-Interactive-Gesture-Controlled-Particle-System
Interactive 3D particle system using Three.js and MediaPipe. It tracks hand landmarks via webcam to morph 20,000 particles into hearts or text based on gestures (fists/pinches). Features smooth interpolation and physics that react to window movement—merging computer vision with web graphics.
